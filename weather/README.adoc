= Weather Forecast Sample

This sample shows how to use Spring Web Services to connect to the https://wiki.cdyne.com/index.php/CDYNE_Weather[CDYNE Weather Service].
It uses JAXB to generate classes from the service's WSDL, and the `WebServiceTemplate` to
send the request to and receive the response from the service.

You can run the client by using the following command from within this directory:

----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
